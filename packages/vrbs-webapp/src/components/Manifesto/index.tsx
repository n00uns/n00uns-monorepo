                {weVrbs} We came together by the [mutual and ridiculous] conviction that
                NFTs can create and nurture strong communities and networks of people. Strong
                focused communities, with a treasury governed by outcome focused voting, have the
                potential to impact the world in small and big ways üåé.

                Vrbs is a decentralized internet community on the blockchain. We are building a
                protocol for people, called Vrbs Protocol, that empowers voting, funding and
                incubating brilliant ideas. We are an ambitious group of entrepreneurs,
                technologists, investors, developers, engineers, business executives, and artists
                from around the world.
