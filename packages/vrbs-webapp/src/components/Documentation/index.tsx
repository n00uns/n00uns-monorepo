                    In addition to the security and precautions taken by Nouns DAO, Vrbs Developers,
                    and Compound Governance, the Architects have given themselves a special veto
                    right to ensure that no malicious proposals can be passed while the Vrbs supply
                    is low. This veto right will only be used if an obviously harmful governance
                    proposal has been passed, and is intended as a last resort.

                    The Vrbs community has undertaken a preliminary exploration of proposal veto
                    alternatives (â€˜rage quitâ€™ etc.), but it is now clear that this is a difficult
                    problem that will require significantly more research, development and testing
                    before a satisfactory solution can be implemented.

                    The Architects consider the veto an emergency power that should not be exercised
                    in the normal course of business. Architects will veto proposals that introduce
                    non-trivial legal or existential risks to the DAO, including (but not
                    necessarily limited to) proposals that:

                    There are unfortunately no algorithmic solutions for making these determinations
                    in advance (if there were, the veto would not be required), and proposals must
                    be considered on a case by case basis.

                    The VRBs DAO`s virtuous cycle describes the cycle by which the incentivizing of

                    building from a solid foundation of experienced founders and a proven model. The

                  The purchasing of a VRB NFT grants access to participate in the governance and rewards of the DAO. This governance is responsible for a community treasury, which is grown via a once-a-day auction model + contributions from previously backed projects.

                  Injecting the spirit of VRBs into Nouns ecosystem creates a powerful identity and further strengthens the need for action in this current environment. We are operating under a model of rapid decentralization, meaning, that this DAO framework was developed by a small group of Architects who laid the foundation for the DAO. Once the foundation was developed, a larger group of critically important entrepreneurs, investors, thinkers, and artists, known as the builders (council) further developed the idiosyncratic parts of the DAO.

                  In short, as VRBs become a cultural tour de force, their value will increase and the treasury will grow. As the treasury grows, more ideas will be funded, leading to more projects created and more visions realized. In this way, the jovial characters boasting square-shaped glasses can be the catalyst of real-world changes and good in the world.

                  Both y00t nouns and VRBs are co-equal but serve different and distinct roles in the DAO. It is up to each individual to decide what path they take:

                    Because 100% of Vrb auction proceeds are sent to Vrbs DAO, Vrbs have chosen to
                    compensate themselves with Vrbs. Every 10th Vrb for the first 5 years of the
                    project (Vrb ids #0, #10, #20, #30 and so on) will be automatically sent to the
                    Vrbder's multisig to be vested and shared among the founding members of the
                    project.

                    Vrbder distributions don't interfere with the cadence of 24 hour auctions. Vrbs
                    are sent directly to the Vrbder's Multisig, and auctions continue on schedule
                    with the next available Vrb ID.
